<h1>RAMEN</h1>

<p>Ramen is a japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodles.</p>

<h4>The noodles</h4>
<p>In the old days, a single lump of dough was manually stretched and folded in half dozens of times til it formed a bunch of thin noodles.</p>
<p> There are 2 types of noodles; low or high alkaline and wavy or thick ramen noodles</p>

<h5>Noodle Ingredients:</h5>
<ul>

<li>Flour</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Alkaline mineral water <em>(kansui)</em></li>

</ul>

<p>fun fact- It is the <em>kansui</em> which give Ramen noodles their unique bounce and taste and it also makes them yellow even though they contain no egg.</p> 

<h4>The Broth</h4>
<p>Basic broth contains minimum ingredients, mainly just pork bones or chicken bones or both!</p>


<h4>The Flavour</h4>
<p>Broth + Flavouring = Soup</p>

<ul>

<li>Shio - This means salt and is the traditional soup flavouring</li>
<li>Shoyo- This means soy sauce and is the next oldest flavour. The broth for this tends to not contain pork</li>
<li>Miso - </li>
<li>Tonkotsu - Contains either salt or soy sauce. Made by boiling ground up pork bones for 12-15 hours in the stock and leaves a whitish coloured broth</li>

</ul>

<h4>The Meat</h4>


<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>

<p>If you have left over ramen broth why not add some rice to finish the dish!</p>
